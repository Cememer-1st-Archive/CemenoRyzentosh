Note: This is X570 Pro4's USB Map.

For other motherboards, it is recommended to follow [the guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/).

# BIOS Configuration

- Above 4G Decoding: **Enable**
- Wake on LAN: **Disable** (If it doesn't Disable, PC will have problems with shutdownðŸ¤”)
- Fast Boot: **Disable**
- SATA Operation: AHCI
- Secure Boot: Disable

# Note

## kext
if you do not use Intel Wifi or Polaris GPUs, please remove the kext related to them before using them.
### Only for Polaris GPU
- RadeonBoost.kext
- RadeonMonitor.kext
### Only for Intel Wifi
- IntelBluetoothInjector.kext
- IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext
- AirportItlwm.kext

## DeviceProperties

DeviceProperties are applied to some PCIs, which are set to display the internals of the nvme SSD in macOS.

(SATA SSDs can be configured with ExternalDiskIcons, since they are the drives on which macOS is installed.)

## ACPI

I've put in a lot of .aml files to solve the sleep problem, but haven't solved it yet.
However, this is probably a wifi issue as sleep worked only once when I turned off the wifi.
So I have left it.

## Other

I followed the OpenCore guide for many of the settings.
So if there are any settings you don't understand, you can look at the OpenCore configuration.
